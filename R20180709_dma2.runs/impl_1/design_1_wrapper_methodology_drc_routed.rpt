Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[6] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[6]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[7] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/cycle_counter_0/inst/number_reg[7]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
